Task: Given the time-gated briefs, price features, and current portfolio, output JSON with trade proposals.
Schema: see configs/schemas/decision.schema.json. Do not include any other keys.
Rules:
- Only BUY if estimated upside ≥ 5% over the horizon and after costs.
- Respect limits: ≤15 positions; ≤10% per ticker; ≥5% cash.
- Stops/targets: include optional stop/take_profit as fractions (0.08, 0.12).
- Quantity can be fractional to meet target sizing. Use USD sizing notes if helpful.
- If no compelling opportunities, return empty proposals.
