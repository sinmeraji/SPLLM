# Cursor Rules: File Header Descriptions

- When creating or editing any file, include a brief header description at the top explaining purpose, key responsibilities, and usage if relevant.
- Prefer module docstrings (Python) or top-of-file comments (shell, TS/JS, HTML) in the first 10 lines.
- Keep it concise (2â€“6 lines). Update when responsibilities change.
- Scripts should include usage examples or key env vars when applicable.
