# Cursor Rules: File Header Descriptions

- When creating or editing any file, include a brief header description at the top explaining purpose, key responsibilities, and usage if relevant.
- Prefer module docstrings (Python) or top-of-file comments (shell, TS/JS, HTML) in the first 10 lines.
- Keep it concise (2â€“6 lines). Update when responsibilities change.
- Scripts should include usage examples or key env vars when applicable.

# Cursor Rules: Environment Variables

- Define all environment variables in `configs/env/.env`. Do not hardcode secrets or credentials in code.
- Organize `.env` into grouped sections: API Keys/Credentials, Provider/User-Agents, Scheduler/Live Jobs, App Config.
- When introducing a new env var: add it (with empty/default value) to `.env` with a brief comment, and update `README.md` env section if applicable.
- Scripts and services must source `configs/env/.env` (e.g., `. ./configs/env/.env`) rather than relying on ad-hoc exports.
